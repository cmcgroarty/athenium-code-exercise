Question 1: SQL
----------------
Assume you have the following tables:
Item
+-------------+--------------+------+-----+----------------+
| Field | Type | Null | Key | Extra |
+-------------+--------------+------+-----+----------------+
| itemID | int(11) | | PRI | auto_increment |
| name | varchar(64) | | | |
| description | varchar(128) | YES | | |
| categoryID | int(11) | YES | | |
+-------------+--------------+------+-----+----------------+
Category
+-------------+--------------+------+-----+----------------+
| Field | Type | Null | Key | Extra |
+-------------+--------------+------+-----+----------------+
| categoryID | int(11) | | PRI | auto_increment |
| name | varchar(64) | | | |
+-------------+--------------+------+-----+----------------+
ItemOrderMembership
+-------------+--------------+------+-----+----------------+
| Field | Type | Null | Key | Extra |
+-------------+--------------+------+-----+----------------+
| orderID | int(11) | | | |
| itemID | int(11) | | | |
+-------------+--------------+------+-----+----------------+
Write a query that will get me the item name and item category name for
all items in orderID 12345. Please note that Item.categoryID may be NULL,
and that the query should return item names even for those records where
this is the case.

Question 2: Programming
-----------------------
A teacher gives a class of students an exam. He decides to grade the
exam using the following method:
* A score in the top 20% of all scores is an A.
* A score in the next 20% of scores is a B.
* A score in the next 20% of scores is a C.
* A score in the next 20% of scores is a D.
* A score in the bottom 20% of scores is an F.

For example, if a class of 20 students has the following scores:
99, 92, 91, 91, 89, 85, 83, 82, 80, 79, 78, 78, 77, 76, 75, 74, 62, 55, 43, 20
The first four scores (99, 92, 91, 91) would be an A, scores 5 through 8 (89,
85, 83, 82) would be a B, scores 9 through 12 (80, 79, 78, 78) would be a C,
scores 13 through 16 would be a D (77, 76, 75, 74) and scores 17 through 20
(62, 55, 43, 20) would be an F.

Write a function that takes an arbitrary (possibly unsorted) score list of any
length (not necessarily the list used as an example above) as a parameter, and
returns a grade for each score.

Note that since the list of scores can be of any length the number of scores
may not necessarily be divisible by 5. Please make sure your function will
handle those cases gracefully and consistently.
ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT: If there are two (or more) scores that are identical,
then those identical numerical scores must always receive the same grade, even
if that causes some grades to contain more scores than others.
You may use any programming language you wish. Please make sure your code is
syntactically valid and would produce an output that identifies which letter
grade is received by each numerical score in the input list.
